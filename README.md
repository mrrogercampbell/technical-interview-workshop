# Technical Interview Workshop
Let's get one thing straight: **Everyone eats, sleeps, and farts just like you!**

Technical interview can be nerve racking. I mean come on you have someone literally testing your knowledge and trying to trip you up with tough question. Or so you think.

So you are probably like, "Well duh Roger! I am expecting you to make me ready for them!"

## Objectives
By the end of this workshop you as Software Engineers should:
1. Understand where technical interviews fit within the interview process for a Software Engineer and or Developer role.
2. Be conformable discussing and performing technical interview best practices.

Roger Campbell II
- I am a:
  - General Assembly Alumni
  - Software Engineer:
    - Code Differently
  - Instructor:
    - General Assembly
    - Code Differently
  - Principal Consultant:
    - GemStack Solutions
- I have been in the tech industry for over 5 years and a Engineer for 2 years.

## Lets Talk Turkey
Some of the most common questions I am asked by students and Junior Engineers:
1. "Why do I have to do a technical challenge?!"
   - Technical interview give companies the opportunity to:
     - See how you think
     - Something else
2. What does the Interview process look like?
   - 1st Stage: Phone Behavioral Screening and Technical Questions
   - 2nd Stage: Remote Coding Interview or Assignment
   - 3rd Stage: Onsite or Remote Interview
     - With Possible: Whiteboarding and or Live Coding Challenge
3. What kind of questions are asked during a technical interview?
   - There are 5 types of technical interviews:
     1. Behavioral
     2. Technical Questions
     3. Code Challenge
     4. Whiteboarding
     5. Live Coding Interview

## Technical Questions
Technical question are normally asked at multiple points of the interviewing process. But overall I would expect them during the initial phone screening and second round interview. The purpose of this stage is to get a benchmark on your current skill level in regards to software engineering theory rather that practicality.

The types of questions to expect are:
- Algorithm
- Data Structures
- Language Fundamentals
- API Basics

### How to Ace The Technical Questions
- Anchor your thinking process and your conclusions along the way
- Repeat the question to the interviewer to be sure you understand what it is they are asking
- Ask for clarification if it is a cryptic question
- Ask questions that can lead you to a possible solution
- Be honest and say I do not know


## Behavioral Interview
Whereas a behavioral challenges are pretty standard in all job interviews they are especially important when it comes to Software Engineering and Develop roles. There is a huge misconception that all Engineers and Developers like to code all night long in their parents dark basement while surfacing the dark web.

Ok.. Well in some cases that might be true but as a Engineer or Developer in the workforce you will be expected to work with a team. Sometimes that team will consist of other Engineers and developers or it might be non-technical people such as a Project Manager or even the companies CEO.

### Importance of Behavioral Interviews
1. Gives the team a chance to see if they could stand working with you for 30-40 hours a week?
   - It also gives you the same opportunity
2. Give the interviewer a better opportunity to understand the details of your work experience and how you work.

### How to beat the Behavioral Interview
1. Be honest yourself!
   - Just as much as the interviewer is interviewing you, you are interviewing them.
     - You do not want to work for a company or team that you can not get along with.
2. Utilize the S.T.A.R. Method:
   - **S**ituation: Describe the `situation` by providing relevant and necessary details.
   - **T**ask: Explain the `task` you were responsible for in that accomplishing.
   - **A**ction: Explain what `actions` you took to complete the task.
   - **R**esult: Outline the `result` of your efforts and highlight the positive effects it had for on the situation.

## Code Challenge
`Code Challenges` are the most common things to expect from a during the interview process for a Software Engineer or Developer. They will consist of a technical problem that the company will send you to complete, normally on your own within a specify deadline.

### How to beat the Code Challenge
- Best way to beat a code challenge is to do code challenges
  - Sites like the following are going to be your new best friend:
    - [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/)
    - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
    - [TopCoder](https://www.topcoder.com/challenges/?pageIndex=1)
    - [FreeCodeCamp: 10 Most Popular Coding Challenge Sites](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-10-most-popular-coding-challenge-websites-of-2016-fb8a5672d22f/)
- If you cant figure out the challenge dope in as much pseudo code and you can and notes on how you would go about researching the challenge you were given.

## Whiteboarding
The goal of a `whiteboard` challenge is for you to convey how you think and reason your way through a challenging problem.

Traditional this challenge is given to you in person and is performed in front of either the interviewer and or an interviewing panel.

They will ask you a challenging question and then ask you to write out how you would approach solving the issue.

### How to Beat The Whiteboard
- TALK OUT LOUD!
  - One of the biggest thing interviewers are trying to see with this type of challenge is how do you reason.
  - It is extremely important to say anything and everything you are thinking out loud.
- Write out `pseudo code`
  - Pseudo code show that you are logically working towards a solutions by dissecting the problem.
- When in doubt... Ask a questions
  - One common pitfall for Juniors is that they think they are supposed to know everything; `you will never know more than you don't know`
  - Normally Interviewers ask you a to solve a problem and purposefully do not give you enough details to solve it so that you will ask questions.
- Remember the point of the challenge is not to solve the solution but to show them you are a capable thinking.


**Fun Fact:** Whiteboard challenges originated from a time before laptops, when it was hard to to have an interviewee code on an actual computer. Old habits die hard, and this is one of them.

## Live Code Interview
By far considered one of the toughest stages of the interviewing process is the `Live Coding` Interview. At this stage in the game you have normally had a `behavioral interview`, been asked `technical questions`, and possibly done a `whiteboarding challenge`.

During this stage interviewers will either provide you or have you open a blank IDE and code out a solutions right there in front of them. Scary right?!

One main there to realize here is that similar to the `whiteboarding challenge` interviews are not expecting you to finish the challenge in the interview.
What they are looking to see is:
- How you structure your code
- How you think through a problem
- And basic understanding of the language they let you code in

### How to beat the Live Coding Interview
- Practice, practice, oh and practice
  - This is where those coding challenge sites I shared will also come in handy.
    - [FreeCodeCamp: 10 Most Popular Coding Challenge Sites](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-10-most-popular-coding-challenge-websites-of-2016-fb8a5672d22f/)
- Don't jump without asking where to land
  - The worse thing you can do is jump right in and start coding once the interviewer has given you the problem to solve and tells you to go.
  - Normally they have intentionally not given you enough information to solve the problem.
    - They want to see if you are going to BS your way through or ask a question when needed.
- Just make the code run!
  - Do not worry about writing super elegant code, just get a workable solution.
  - Once you have a workable solution then and only then worry about elegancy.
  - Remember:
    - Make it Work
    - Make it Pretty
    - Make it Fast
