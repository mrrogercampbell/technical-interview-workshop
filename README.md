# Technical Interview Workshop
Let's get one thing straight: **Everyone eats, sleeps, and farts just like you!**

Technical interview can be nerve racking. I mean come on you have someone literally testing your knowledge and trying to trip you up with tough question. Or so you think.

So you are probably like, "Well duh Roger! I am expecting you to make me ready for them!"
